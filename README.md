# CPLN 503: Modeling Geographical Objects

Department of City and Regional Planning

University of Pennsylvania

Fall 2024

Instructor: Dr. Jamaal Green

## Course Goals and Objectives

Geographic information systems (GIS) are configurations of computer
hardware and software specifically designed for the acquisition, storage, retrieval,
maintenance, analysis, synthesis, and presentation of cartographic data in digital form. This
course introduces the fundamental conventions and capabilities of GIS from a broad and
practical perspective. Practical applications of GIS require a more nuanced approach than
simply learning the “point and click” techniques of the software. This course is designed
around the belief that the most vexing spatial challenges are not solved through a technical
competency of GIS alone but also an appreciation of its possibilities. As such, this course will
emphasize creative logic and non-linear problem-solving as much as it will emphasize the
development of hard skills. In contrast to the introductory course on GIS that is offered in the
spring semester (Modeling Geographical Space), this course is oriented toward use of vector
GIS. Vector GIS involves the modeling of discrete objects in geographical space (buildings,
water bodies, land parcels) rather than continuous qualities of space itself (proximity,
density)

To master the art and science of GIS, students must also gain an appreciation for the
complexities of finding, extracting, and cleaning useable data. Students must learn well-
defined and accepted processes for modeling urban geographies while also cultivating a non-
linear approach for how to apply familiar processes in unfamiliar ways. Finally, students must
understand how to translate their work into a format that can be easily appreciated and
digested by diverse audiences.


Additionally, all of these features may be further enhanced through the use of
scripting. While this is not a statistical or geographic programming course, I will offer demonstrations
on how we can use the statistical programming language R to augment our GIS work. Many
of you will probably be in the process of just starting to use R, and you should consider this
course as a complement to your quantitative methods courses. There will not be a requirement to use
R for your projects, but I hope the demonstrations will show that using R in a pragmatic fashion can 
make your lives easier as you move through the course.

The first section of this course (~35%) takes inspiration from the maxim that analysis is only
as good as the data that supports it. Students will learn how to find and judge the quality of data, how to extract, 
clean, and organize diverse formats, and how to correctly apply the data to specific analytics.
The second section of the course (~65%) builds off the first by teaching students how to import and leverage data through
powerful and relevant tools and analytical processes, especially those common to urban planning, design, and development. Key
tools of focus include data management (joins, selections); modifying geometries (clip, union, intersect); summarizing data
and trends (summarize, spatial join, dissolve); modeling transportation networks (network analyst); practical raster (density,
interpolation); and statistical modeling. This section of the course will take an inductive approach, deconstructing the tools for the students 
and challenging them on how to apply them in practical settings. Interspersed throughout the semester will be one or two multi-week projects 
in which students will synthesize and build upon the tools and techniques learned in class to solve real--
world challenges and apply GIS in several practical situations. The specific content of this
section will evolve based upon the progression of the semester. Some examples of analyses the
students may focus on include:
- Modeling trends in population change to support population health assessments
- Using GIS to model the impacts of gerrymandering in key swing states
- Modeling for-sale and rental housing markets sites to inform future developments
- Using GIS to assist in a very peculiar “disaster management” scenario
